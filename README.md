# Infrastructure Overview

This Overview repository is a specification and documentation component of the Infrastructure Project. Please do not add code or other resources to this repository.

Infrastructure for the various parts of our organization, including tools, methods, howtos, and so much more.

Note that herein we will cover any or all of

* [Innovate for Vegas Foundation and innovateforvegas.org](https://innovateforvegas.org) website and associated infrastructure, tools, utils, etc.
* [CreateFor.Vegas](https://createfor.vegas) website and associated stuff
* [CodeFor.Vegas](https://codefor.vegas) website and associated stuff

As with all overview (ov-) project repositories, this repo contains associated and helpful documents and suggested for code or other components that will be developed and tracked in other repositories.

The documents contained within this repository will ideally be helpful and useful in general, rather than describing and/or specifying a particular project and its components.

## Project Policies

Unless otherwise and specifically indicated with replacement files in this repository, this project will adhere to the default Innovate for Vegas Foundation policies for Code of Conduct and Contributing, found at

* [Contributing to this Project - Innovate for Vegas Foundation](https://github.com/InnovateForVegas/.github/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)

## Organization Workflow

All Innovate for Vegas Foundation projects, whether CodeFor or CreateFor, assume contributors and collaborators are familiar with the HOWTOs that detail such things as use of GitHub, the difference between CodeFor and CreateFor parts of our organization, and our approach to Agile for Volunteers (or Volunteer Agile) which will, like all our projects, be a collaborative work in progress. These, coupled with the Contributing document linked above, are important and you should be familiar with them before diving in.

## Specification Documents

The specification(s) for the various components and goals of this project are located in the [Doc](doc/README.md) directory. Note that there should be localized versions of the specification documents as needed in this subdirectory.

## Project Backlog

As this project adds component repositories, specific GitHub issues may be opened against individual repos for relevant bugs, missing features, and so on. Prior to the relevant repository existing, an issue backlog may be created against this overview repository. When an appropriate component repository has been created, an issue may be created against the repository with a reference to the issue opened against this overview repository (Double-linking is encouraged).
