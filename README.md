# Infrastructure Overview

This Overview repository is a specification and documentation component of the Infrastructure Project. Please do not add code or other resources to this repository.

Infrastructure for the various parts of our organization, including tools, methods, howtos, and so much more.

Note that herein we will cover any or all of

* [Innovate for Vegas Foundation and innovateforvegas.org](https://innovateforvegas.org) website and associated infrastructure, tools, utils, etc.
* [CreateFor.Vegas](https://createfor.vegas) website and associated stuff
* [CodeFor.Vegas](https://codefor.vegas) website and associated stuff

As with all overview (ov-) project repositories, this repo contains associated and helpful documents and suggested for code or other components that will be developed and tracked in other repositories.

The documents contained within this repository will ideally be helpful and useful in general, rather than describing and/or specifying a particular project and its components.

## Project Policies

Unless otherwise and specifically indicated with replacement files in this repository, this project will adhere to the default Innovate for Vegas Foundation policies for Code of Conduct and Contributing, found at

* [Code of Conduct - Innovate for Vegas Foundation](https://github.com/InnovateForVegas/.github/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)
* [Contributing to this Project - Innovate for Vegas Foundation](https://github.com/InnovateForVegas/.github/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)

## Organization Workflow

All Innovate for Vegas Foundation projects, whether CodeFor or CreateFor, assume contributors and collaborators are familiar with the HOWTOs that detail such things as use of GitHub, the difference between CodeFor and CreateFor parts of our organization, and our approach to Agile for Volunteers (or Volunteer Agile) which will, like all our projects, be a collaborative work in progress. These, coupled with the Contributing document linked above, are important and you should be familiar with them before diving in.

* [Organization HOWTOs](https://github.com/InnovateForVegas/doc-org-howtos)

## Moving This Organization Forward Together

In order to remain somewhat organized (we are all volunteers, after all), please file an Issue against this repository for any organization and infrastructure items that need attention, that do not have an existing project repository open and active (this is true of all projects, in fact). If there is something missing from the HOWTO repository above, file the issue (or a pull request if you are feeling proactive) there, of course, but the general backlog of our organizational and infrastructural issues goes here.

If you are not already in possession of a GitHub account, or if you need to become a member of our organization to participate with the rest of us, please check out this page of our HOWTOs (especially Getting Started item 2, but do read the whole thing!):
