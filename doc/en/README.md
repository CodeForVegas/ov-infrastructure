# Infrastructure Project Specification

The Infrastructure project is composed of several components, including documentation for onboarding and volunteer participants, foundation website parts, tools, utilities, and anything else needed to make our Foundation go.

The specification is broken down along those component lines with the following (with links to individual local specification files):

| Component                                        | Description                                                     |
