# Infrastructure for C for V Overview

Infrastructure for the various parts of our organization, including tools, methods, howtos, and so much more.

Note that __C for V__ here is any and all of

* Code for Vegas Foundation and [codeforvegas.org](https://codeforvegas.org) website
* [CreateFor.Vegas](https://createfor.vegas) website and associated stuff
* [CodeFor.Vegas](https://codefor.vegas) website and associated stuff

As with all overview (ov-) project repositories, this repo contains associated and helpful documents and suggested for code or other components that will be developed and tracked in other repositories.

The documents contained within this repository will ideally be helpful and useful in general, rather than describing and/or specifying a particular project and its components.
