# Infrastructure Overview

This Overview repository is a specification and documentation component of the Infrastructure Project. Please do not add code or other resources to this repository.

Infrastructure for the various parts of our organization, including tools, methods, howtos, and so much more.

Note that herein we will cover any or all of

* [Innovate for Vegas Foundation and innovateforvegas.org](https://innovateforvegas.org) website and associated infrastructure, tools, utils, etc.
* [CreateFor.Vegas](https://createfor.vegas) website and associated stuff
* [CodeFor.Vegas](https://codefor.vegas) website and associated stuff

As with all overview (ov-) project repositories, this repo contains associated and helpful documents and suggested for code or other components that will be developed and tracked in other repositories.

The documents contained within this repository will ideally be helpful and useful in general, rather than describing and/or specifying a particular project and its components.
